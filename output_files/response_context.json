No. 182 of 2004.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">FACTS :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\"> \tM/s. Centrotrade Minerals and Metal Inc. (for short, &quot;Centrotrade&quot;), \nAppellant in SLP (C) No. 18611 of 2004 and the Hindustan Copper Limited \n(for short &quot;HCL&quot;), Appellant in SLP (C) No. 21340 of 2004 entered into a \ncontract for sale of 15,500 DMT of Copper Concentrate to be delivered at \nKandla Port in the State of Gujarat in two separate consignments. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\"> \tThe said goods were ultimately required to be used at the Khetri Plant \nof HCL situated in the State of Rajasthan.  The seller in terms of the contract \nwas required to submit a quality certificate from an internationally reputed \nassayer, mutually acceptable to the parties.  After the consignments were \ndelivered, the payments therefor had been made.  However, a dispute arose \nbetween the parties as regard the dry weight of concentrate copper.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">Clause 14 of the contract contained an arbitration agreement which  \nreads as under:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">&quot;All disputes or differences whatsoever arising between \nthe parties out of, or relating to, the construction, \nmeaning and operation or effect of the contract or the \nbreach thereof shall be settled by arbitration in India \nthrough the arbitration panel of the Indian Council of \nArbitration in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of \nthe Indian Council of Arbitration.  If either party is in \ndisagreement with the arbitration result in India, either \nparty will have the right to appeal to a second arbitration \nin London, UK in accordance with the rules of \nconciliation and arbitration of the International Chamber \nof Commerce in effect on the date hereof and the results \nof this second arbitration will be binding on both the \nparties.  Judgment upon the award may be entered in any \ncourt in jurisdiction.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">\tCentrotrade invoked the arbitration clause.  The Arbitrator appointed \nby the Indian Council of Arbitration made a NIL award.  Centrotrade \nthereupon invoked the second part of the said arbitration agreement on or \nabout 22nd February, 2000.  An award was made pursuant thereto.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">SUIT BY HCL :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">   \tHCL, during pendency of the proceedings before the arbitrator, filed a \nsuit in the court at Khetri in the State of Rajasthan questioning initiation of \nthe second arbitration proceeding before International Chamber of \nCommerce inter alia contending that the provision for second arbitration was \nvoid and a nullity.  No interim order was passed therein despite having been \nprayed for, whereupon an appeal was preferred by HCL before the District \nJudge, which was also dismissed.  In a revision filed by HCL, the High \nCourt granted an injunction.  In the meanwhile the sole arbitrator had \ncommenced arbitration proceedings.  Centrotrade filed a special leave \napplication before this Court questioning the said order of injunction passed \nby the Rajasthan High Court and by an order dated 8th February, 2001, the \nsaid order of interim injunction was vacated.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">ARBITRATION PROCEEDING :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\"> \tMr. Jeremy Cooke, Arbitrator held his sittings in London.  HCL, in a \nseries of letters to the International Court of Arbitration and to the \nArbitrator, maintained that the arbitration agreement was void being \nopposed to public policy.  Despite the same, they, through their attorney, \nconsulted about the procedural aspects of the arbitration and had asked for \ntheir submissions in relation to the procedure, progress and substance of the \ndispute.  HCL also received copies of all correspondence passed between \nCentrotrade and the Arbitrator and of all submissions made.  They had been \ngiven every opportunity to take any point which they wished to take in their \ndefence.  Centrotrade served their submissions and supporting evidence by \nthe orders made by the Arbitrator on 20th December, 2000, 19th January, \n2001 and 3rd May, 2001.  When no defence submission or supporting \nevidence was produced by HCL within the time prescribed, a fax was sent to \nthem by the learned Arbitrator on 30th July, 2001 giving it one last \nopportunity to inform him by return of any intention on their part to put in a \ndefence and to seek an extension of time for doing so.  A further fax was \nsent on 9th August, 2001 whereby the Arbitrator informed the parties that he \nwas proceeding with the award.  On 11th August, 2001, the Arbitrator \nreceived a fax from Fox &amp; Mandal (representing HCL) requesting for \nextension of time for one month to put in a defence, pursuant whereto on \n16th August, it was directed that any submission in support of an application \nfor extension of time for a defence and any submissions on the substantive \nmerits of the dispute together with any evidence relied in relation to the \napplication and any submissions made thereupon should be received by him \nby 31st August, 2001 in absence whereof he would not give any \nconsideration thereto.  On 27th August, 2001, Fox &amp; Mandal sought for a \nfurther three weeks&#x27; extension of time for making their submissions and \nserving supporting evidence, pursuant whereto a time for filing those \nsubmissions of evidence was extended until 12th September, 2001.  \nSubmissions containing about seventy five pages were received by the \nArbitrator on 13th September, 2001 without any supporting evidence or any \njustification for not complying with the earlier orders passed by him.  The \nArbitrator, however, considered the submissions made by HCL in making \nthe award.    \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">AWARD :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\"> \tAn award was passed by the said Arbitrator on 29th September, 2001 \nholding :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">(i)\tthe arbitration clause contained in clause 14 of the agreement is \nneither unlawful nor invalid.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">(ii)\tthe Arbitrator had jurisdiction to decide his own jurisdiction in terms \nof <a href=\"/doc/133912/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 8.3</a> of the ICC Rules as also <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 16</a> of the 1996 Act.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">(iii)\tthe claim of Centrotrade based on the report of Inspectorate Griffith \nwas just.

HCL also filed a suit \nbefore the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Alipore which was marked as T.S. \nNo. 78 of 2001 praying for a declaration that the ICC award is void and a \nnullity, as also for permanent injunction and damages.  \n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">Enforcement of Award :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\"> \tCentrotrade, in the meanwhile, filed an application for enforcement of \nthe said award dated 29th September, 2001 in the Court of the District Judge, \nAlipore which was numbered as Execution Case No. 1 of 2002.  Upon an \napplication made in terms of Clause 13 of the Letters Patents of the Calcutta \nHigh Court by Centrotrade, the said execution case was transferred to the \nCalcutta High Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\"> \tA learned Single Judge of the said court by a judgment and order \ndated 10th March, 2004 allowed the said execution petition.  Aggrieved by \nand dissatisfied therewith, HCL preferred an appeal which was allowed by \nreason of the impugned order dated 20th May, 2004.  Both the parties are \nbefore us questioning the correctness of the said judgment.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">HIGH COURT JUDGMENT :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\"> \tIn its judgment, the High Court held:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">(i)\tAlthough successive arbitration is not impermissible in India, but two \nsuccessive awards are mutually destructive.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">(ii) \tIn his award, Mr. Cooke did not make any statement that he was \noverruling or setting aside or in any manner altering the Indian award.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">(iii)\tAlthough the second award is binding on the parties but is not \nenforceable having regard to the first award.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">(iv)\tThe second award is not a foreign award within the meaning of \n<a href=\"/doc/1211237/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 44</a> of the 1996 Act and, thus, <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 34</a> thereof would apply thereto \nin the facts and circumstances of the case.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">(v)\t<a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_7\">Neither Part II of the Act</a> nor <a href=\"/doc/752204/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 51</a> thereof states anywhere \neither expressly or by necessary implication, that the definition of &#x27;Foreign \nAward&#x27; contained in <a href=\"/doc/1211237/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 44</a> would apply notwithstanding the proper law \nof the contract being Indian Law.  \n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">SUBMISSIONS :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\"> \tMr. S. Sarkar, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of \nCentrotrade  submitted that:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">(i)\tIn a two-tier arbitration, the second arbitration proceedings having \ntaken place in London, the award of Mr. Cooke was a foreign award within \nthe meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1211237/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 44</a> of the Act.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">(ii) \tThe learned Single Judge was satisfied that the HCL was not unable to \npresent his case in the arbitration proceedings within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/848413/\" id=\"a_11\">Section \n48(1)(b)</a> of the Act which finding having not been reversed by the Division \nBench, no case has been made out for setting aside the award.

The Arbitrator, having \nproceeded to prepare an award without the pleadings of the parties before \nhim and considering only the first part of the written statement without \nwaiting for the second part, misconducted himself at the proceeding.  Had an \nopportunity been given, HCL could have cross-examined the expert on \nwhose report, the award has been made. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">(vi) \tNeither any issue was raised, nor any date was fixed for hearing and, \nas the parties were not given an opportunity to examine the witnesses, the \naward is liable to be set aside in terms of <a href=\"/doc/848413/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 48(1)(b)</a> of the 1996 Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">(vii)\tThe judgment of the High Court to the extent that the arbitration \nclause has been held to be valid is erroneous. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">VALIDITY OF THE AGREEMENT :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\"> \tSo far as the question of validity of the arbitration agreement between \nthe parties is concerned, we may at the outset notice that the said question \nwas specifically raised by HCL both before the learned Single Judge and the \nDivision Bench of the High Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\"> \t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1269359\" id=\"span_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"52856\" id=\"span_3\">Both the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench held the said \narbitration agreement to be valid.  The Arbitrator as also the High Court in \nsupport of their findings on the said question relied upon the decisions of the \nCalcutta High Court in Hiralal Agarwalla &amp; Co. Vs. Jokin Nahopier &amp; Co. \nLtd. [AIR 1927 Cal 647], the Bombay High Court in <a href=\"/doc/52856/\" id=\"a_21\">Fazalally Jivaji Raja \nVs.

In terms of <a href=\"/doc/1427249/\" id=\"a_33\">Section \n19(1)(f)</a>, an appeal shall lie to the High Court against an award of the \narbitrator except in cases where the amount thereof does not exceed an \namount prescribed in this behalf by rule made by the Central Government.  \n<a href=\"/doc/1427249/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 19(1)(g)</a> provided that save as provided in the said section and in \nany rules made thereunder nothing in any law for the time being in force \nshall apply to arbitrations under that section.  Construing the aforementioned \nprovisions, this Court held:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">&quot;14. The principles being thus well-settled, we have to \nsee in the present case whether an appeal to the High \nCourt under <a href=\"/doc/1731368/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 19(l)(f)</a> of the Act comes before it as \na Court or as arbitrator. Under <a href=\"/doc/1731368/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 19(l)(b)</a>, the \nreference is admittedly to an arbitrator. He need not even \nbe a Judge of a Court. It is sufficient that he is qualified \nto be appointed a Judge of the High Court. And under the \nlaw, no appeal would have laid to the High Court against \nthe decision of such an arbitrator. Thus, the provision for \nappeal to the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1427249/\" id=\"a_37\">section 19(1)(f)</a> can only \nbe construed as a reference to it as an authority \ndesignated and not as a Court. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"580886\" id=\"span_5\">The fact that, in the \npresent case, the reference was to a District Judge would \nnot affect the position. Then again, the decision of the \narbitrator appointed under Section l9(l)(b) is expressly \nreferred to in <a href=\"/doc/1731368/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 19(l)(f)</a> as an award. Now, an \nappeal is essentially a continuation of the original \nproceedings, and if the proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1731368/\" id=\"a_39\">Section \n19(l)(b)</a> are arbitration proceedings, it is difficult to see \nhow their character can suffer a change, when they are \nbrought up before an Appellate Tribunal.

It has \nembodied the relevant rules of the modern law but does not contain all the \nprovisions thereof.  The 1996 Act, however, is not as extensive as the \n<a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_85\">English Arbitration Act</a>.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">\tDifferent statutes operated in the field in respect of a domestic award \nand a foreign award prior to coming into force of the 1996 Act, namely, the \n1940 <a href=\"/doc/777085/\" id=\"a_86\">Act, the Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act, 1937</a> and the \n<a href=\"/doc/142812771/\" id=\"a_87\">Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961</a>.  All the \naforementioned statutes have been repealed by the 1996 Act and make \nprovisions in two different parts, namely, matters relating to domestic award \nand foreign award respectively.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">\tThe Scheme of 1996 Act is absolutely distinct and different from the \n1940 Act as also the 1961 Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\"> \tIn the 1940 Act, no reason was required to be stated in the award \nunless otherwise agreed upon.  In the 1996 Act, reasons are required to be \nstated unless agreed to otherwise by the parties.  The court&#x27;s intervention is \nsought to be minimized under the provisions of the 1996 Act not only having \nregard to the concerns expressed in the international community as regard \ndelay in the arbitration proceedings but also in view of the fact that an award \nunder the 1996 is to be a reasoned one.  In a large number of judgments, this \nCourt has emphasized that the extent of power of the court&#x27;s intervention in \nrelation to a reasoned award and unreasoned one would be different.  \nWhereas in relation to an unreasoned award, the court&#x27;s jurisdiction to \ninterfere with the award was absolutely limited, a greater latitude had been \ngiven in relation to a reasoned award.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">\tAfter the 1996 Act came into force, under <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 16</a> of the Act the \nparty questioning the jurisdiction of the arbitrator has an obligation to raise \nthe said question before the arbitrator.  Such a question of jurisdiction could \nbe raised if it is beyond the scope of his authority.  Such a question was \nrequired to be raised during arbitration proceedings or soon after initiation \nthereof as a preliminary issue.  Such a decision would be subject to \nchallenge under <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 34</a> of the Act.  In the event, the arbitrator opined \nthat he had no jurisdiction in relation thereto an appeal thereagainst was \nprovided for under <a href=\"/doc/1656413/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 37</a> of the Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\"> \tIn terms the 1940 Act, an award was required to be made a rule of \ncourt.  In such a proceeding, an objection in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1503578/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 30</a> of the 1940 \nAct would be entertained.  Sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1503578/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 30</a> of the 1996 Act \nenjoins a duty upon the Arbitrator to promote settlement.  Such an \napplication was required to be filed within the period specified therefor \nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_93\">Limitation Act, 1963</a>.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\"> \t<a href=\"/doc/1882318/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 31</a> of the 1996 Act is in tune with <a href=\"/doc/354224/\" id=\"a_95\">Article 31</a> of the Model \nLaw.  The requirements contained therein, most of which are mandatory, are \nspecified therein.  Whereas under the 1940 Act only an interim award or \nfinal award could be made;  four types of awards are contemplated under the \n1996 Act, viz., interim award, additional award, settlement or agreed award \nand final award.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\"> \t<a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 33</a> of the 1996 Act clearly postulates that the Arbitrator has \nthe jurisdiction to correct and interpret an award in terms whereof, he may \namend his core award.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">AWARD UNDER THE 1996 ACT :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\"><a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 34</a> of the Act provides for the mode and manner in which an \narbitral award can be questioned.  Such a course can be taken only by filing \nan application which shall be in accordance with sub-section (2) and sub-\nsection (3).  An award in the Indian part of the award, thus, could be set \naside only by filing an application.  The law, therefore, does not contemplate \nthat despite the rigour of <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 34</a> of the Act, an award which although not \nchallenged and becomes enforceable and executable still can be subject \nmatter of a foreign award.  An award as soon as it becomes enforceable, it \nbecomes final and binding in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1912867/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 35</a> of the Act.\n \tThe award, which is finally being either made by way of partial award \nor final award, after the expiry of a period of thirty days becomes a decree in \nterms of <a href=\"/doc/1286256/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 36</a> of the 1996 Act.  When an award has been made, signed \nand delivered to the parties, it is final and binding on the parties and persons \nclaiming under them respectively.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\"> \tBy reason of <a href=\"/doc/1286256/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 36</a> of the 1996 Act, a legal fiction has been \ncreated to the effect that on expiry of the period prescribed for setting aside \nan award as envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 34</a> of the Act, the award becomes \ncapable of being executed and enforced.  The concept of provision for an \nappeal before another forum from an award and that too when a part of the \naward would be a domestic award and another part would be a foreign award \nis not contemplated under the 1996 Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\"> \tAn appeal as against an award in terms of an agreement may be or \nmay not be filed within the time specified under <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 34</a> of the Act.  Even \nthe appellate arbitrator (if we may use the said term) would have no \njurisdiction to pass an order of injunction staying the operation of the \noriginal award of the arbitrator.  The 1996 does not contemplate that only \nbecause an appeal has been filed against the award, the time envisaged under \n<a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 34</a> shall cease to run.  If during pendency of the so-called appeal an \naward becomes a decree, the appellate arbitrator cannot set aside the said \ndecree.  An appeal contemplates that the procedure before both the \nauthorities would be the same.  An appeal is a continuation of the same \nproceeding.  It does not comprehend two different procedures, two separate \nsets of evidences.  An appeal does not take away the nature of the award.  In \nother words, two different nature of the awards is not contemplated; only \nbecause there is a provision for appeal.  We are not oblivious of the fact that \nrules of some chambers contemplate such a provision but in such an event \nthe one that is made by the first arbitrator does not become final.  The appeal \ncommittee follows the same procedure, relies upon the same evidence unless \nadditional evidence either by consent of the parties or otherwise is permitted.  \nBy reason of such a procedure applicability of different set of rules is not \nenvisaged.  It is within the same jurisdiction.  It does not contemplate two \ndifferent and distinct jurisdictions.  But in the present case, parties were not \nbound by any such agreement of trade or community association. As the \nparties were individual companies and only guided by their agreement, the \nabove situation may not be applicable.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">\tIt is not in dispute that the provisions contained in Part I and Part II of \nthe 1996 Act are distinct and different.  Procedures for enforcing such \nawards are different.  Consequences of the awards made under two different \nparts are absolutely different.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">\tWhat can be contemplated under the UNCITRAL Model Rule is Med-\nArb contracts or similar such contracts and not a contract of present nature.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\"> \tAccording to <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 34(3)</a> of the 1996 Act, the maximum period of \nlimitation for making an application is three months from the date on which \nthe applicant had received the arbitral award or the request under <a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_106\">section 33</a> \nwas disposed of and another thirty days from the last day of the third month. \n<a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 34</a> which refers to &quot;challenge to arbitral award&quot; strives to balance \nbetween the party autonomy and judicial control of the arbitral result with \nthe object of speed and efficiency. The balance has to come down strongly \nin favour of finality, and against judicial review, except in few \ncircumstances. So, the main object of the provision is to determine the \nwhether the award has become final and binding or not. Thus, the section \ndepicts a position whereby an arbitral award can be challenged for the \npurpose of setting aside of the same at the first instance without much delay. \nThe Court would set aside the award only on certain circumstances. \nThereby, it is the legislative intention that such a matter is settled without \nmuch delay or much intervention of court. So, the finality of the challenged \naward would be decided by Court under <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_108\">section 34</a> of the 1996 Act and \nappeals are allowed against certain orders of courts or tribunals on certain \ngrounds under <a href=\"/doc/1656413/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 37</a> of the Act [Furthermore, <a href=\"/doc/382407/\" id=\"a_110\">section 37(3)</a> provides \nthat no second appeal shall lie from an order passed in appeal, although it \ndoes not take away the right to appeal in Supreme Court]. Throughout, the \nprovisions nowhere it is mentioned that an appeal can be made or an \napplication can be filed against the award to a separate arbitration board or \nforum. So, the finality and legality has to be determined by the Court if it is \nso challenged. Otherwise, reference to a second arbitration panel would \nconsume more time as arbitrators would decide the matter after listening the \ndispute afresh. Presuming that the reference to the arbitrator is made for \nsecond time and subsequently arbitrator gives an award, it would be more \ntime consuming and complex if validity of the first award is challenged \nalong with second award. So, following the scheme of the 1996 Act, it is \nmore viable and convenient to accept the first award without opting for \nsecond time arbitration and then to decide it, if the award is challenged. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\"> \tThere can be a situation where an appeal is made against foreign \naward decided and settled  abroad and the appeal will be made in India \naccording to our domestic statute. For example, when one of the parties is an \ninternational company or organisation, first the arbitration will be done \naccording to New York Convention in foreign country and thereafter, if \nthere is any grievance against the award challenge can be made in India \nunder the Act of 1996.\n</blockquote>  \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\"> \tEven the principles analogous to <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_111\">Order XLI, Rule 1 of the Code of \nCivil Procedure</a> envisages that filing of an appeal shall automatically not \nmean stay of the operation of the decree.  In that view of the matter, mere \nfiling of an appeal would not make the award unenforceable.  No prayer for \nstay of the operation of the award had been prayed for nor the appellate \narbitrator had directed stay of the operation of the award.  The 1996 Act \ndoes not contemplate that the arbitrator would be entitled to sit in appeal \nover an executable decree.  Even the doctrine of merger shall not apply \ninasmuch as the said doctrine contemplates an appellate authority who can \npass the same type of order which could be passed by the original authority.  \nIf by fiction of law an award becomes a decree without the intervention of \nthe court, the nature of an award which can be passed by the appellate \narbitrator, would loose the character of an award.  The doctrine of merger, \ntherefore, would not apply.  A decree, whether by reason of a statute or a \nlegal fiction created under the statute, would have different and distinct \nconnotation vis-`-vis an award.  By agreement of the parties, a private \nadjudicator cannot sit in appeal over an enforceable decree.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1721619\" id=\"span_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"121162\" id=\"span_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"623061\" id=\"span_12\">A decree passed \nby a court of law may be set aside by that court itself in exercise of its \nreview jurisdiction or by an appellate court created in terms of a statute.

The 1996 \nAct, however, on the other hand, repeals and replaces not only the 1940 Act \nbut also the 1961 Act and provides for different forums and different \nprocedures for resolution of a dispute through an arbitrator.   It is \ninconceivable that one part of the arbitration agreement shall be enforceable \nas a domestic award but the other part would be enforceable as a foreign \naward.  An award made in terms of one arbitration  agreement can either be \na domestic award or a foreign award; wherefor different procedures have \nbeen laid down, even when the consequences from such award are different \nand when the grounds thereof are also different and distinct.   The \nfundamental legislative policy brought out by the 1996 Act, thus, being not \nin consonance with having two tier arbitration which had two different \nstatutes governed by two different provisions and would be subject to \ndifferent procedures, in our opinion, is not valid.  Whereas, in the decisions \nand authorities relied upon by Mr. Cooke, the second arbitration was also \nbefore the same institution governed by the laws of the same country, in the \ninstant case, the Indian law would be applicable in relation to the first part of \nthe arbitration, namely, the Indian Council of Arbitration, whereas second \npart thereof would be governed by International Chamber of Commerce, \nParis Rules.  Both parts of the arbitration proceeding, therefore, have not \nbeen carried out under the same institution.  An arbitration agreement \nenvisioning different procedures at different stages cannot be countenanced \nunder the 1996 Act.  Had the appeal been provided within the set-up of \nIndian Council of Arbitration, subject to the compliance of time frame, \nprobably the agreement would have been valid.  But, it is not so.  As \nobserved in Hiralal Agarwalla (supra), such a submission must be within a \nsubmission.

Such waiver of right is permissible \neven in relation to a benefit conferred under the law.

Jurisdiction on \nArbitration can be conferred by agreement between the parties.  But, the \ncontract between the parties must be in obedience to law and not in \nderogation thereof.

Magaw J proceeded on the basis that there was \nno contractual provision requiring the buyers to exhaust appeal procedure \nbefore applying to the court for review.

As noticed hereinbefore, it even filed a suit prior to \nentering into the reference by the Arbitrator. Even after the award was \npassed, proceedings before appropriate courts had been initiated.  In its \nwritten statement filed before the arbitral tribunal, the question as regards \nthe jurisdiction of the arbitrator was questioned by it.  The learned arbitrator \nhad, relying on or on the basis of the decisions, referred to hereinbefore, and \nalso an opinion rendered by a former judge of this Court held that such an \narbitration agreement is valid in law.  In terms of <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_197\">Section 16</a> of the 1996 Act, \nthe arbitrator, keeping in view the fact that the question as regard his \njurisdiction had been raised was bound to decide the same before entering \ninto the merit of the matter.  Only in the event, it came to the conclusion that \nthe arbitral tribunal had the requisite jurisdiction, it could have proceeded to \ndetermine  the merit of the matter.  We say so in view of the fact that in the \nevent an arbitrator was of the opinion that he had no jurisdiction in the \nmatter, the arbitration clause being invalid in law, Centrotrade could have \npreferred an appeal in terms of sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1656413/\" id=\"a_198\">Section 37</a> of the 1996 Act. \nThe question as regard lack of inherent jurisdiction on the part of the \narbitrator in view of the second part of the arbitration clause being opposed \nto the public policy could have been raised by HCL in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_199\">Section 34</a> of \nthe 1996 Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\">Even if it is held that two tier arbitration is permissible, under the \n1996 Act it might lead to an incongruity. A two tier arbitration is invalid in \nlaw in the context of the 1996 Act having regard to <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_200\">Section 23</a> of the \nContract Act as statutory jurisdiction cannot be waived by contract. It is, \nthus, amply clear that the very scheme of the 1996 Act does not contemplate \na two tier arbitration agreement of this nature.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_118\">Conditions as regard non-existence or invalidity of an arbitration \nagreement can, in our opinion, be raised while resisting enforcement of a \nforeign award.  <a href=\"/doc/1242720/\" id=\"a_201\">Section 4</a> of the 1996 Act contemplates existence of an \narbitration agreement which would mean a valid arbitration agreement.  If \nthe arbitration agreement is void and of no effect, it is non est in the eye of \nlaw and, thus, cannot be enforced.  An arbitrator derives its jurisdiction from \na reference which would mean a dispute and difference to be adjudicated \nupon in pursuance of or in furtherance of a valid arbitration agreement.  It is \nnot in dispute that the parties agreed that the Indian law shall apply.  The \nvalidity or legality of a contract, thus, must be judged on the touch-stone of \n<a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_202\">Section 23</a> of the Indian Contract Act.  If a contract is opposed to a public \npolicy, the same is void and of no effect. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\">CONCLUSION :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">\tIt is doubtful whether the decisions of the Calcutta, Bombay and \nMadras High Court could have been held to be valid if a situation of the \npresent nature had arisen therein, namely, both the 1940 and 1961 Acts are \napplicable in relation to two different awards made at two different point of \ntime.  The said decisions, therefore, might have been held to be good only  \nin terms of the provisions of the 1940 Act or the 1961 Act but the ratio \nthereof cannot be extended to the cases falling under both the parts of the \n1996 Act.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_121\"> \tTo bring clarity in the matter, we may notice the dichotomy arising \nherein.  If the first award was to be enforced (although no occasion arose \ntherefor), it could have been done only in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_203\">Part I of the Act</a>.  Despite \ninvocation of second part of the arbitration agreement, it would not cease to \nbe a decree in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1286256/\" id=\"a_204\">Section 36</a> of the Act unless the operation thereof \nwas directed to be stayed.   In other words, the first award of the arbitral \ntribunal, on the expiry of the period specified for challenging the award, \nbecame a decree  despite invocation of the second part thereof.  It is difficult \nto comprehend that despite a part of the award becoming a decree of the \ncourt, the same would not be binding upon the arbitral tribunal.  <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_205\">Section 34</a> \nof the 1996 Act provides for setting aside a domestic Indian award.  It unlike  \nthe <a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_206\">English Arbitration Act</a> does not permit the parties to limit or avoid the \noperation of the statutory provisions.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_122\">\tFurthermore, the grounds for questioning a domestic award and a \nforeign award are different.  In the context of the 1996 Act, an arbitration \nagreement which would otherwise be contrary to the provisions of the laws \ngoverning the contract between the parties would be void being opposed to \npublic policy. \n</blockquote>\t\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_123\">\tThe High Court&#x27;s judgment, therefore, in my considered view, cannot \nbe sustained.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_124\"> It is, thus, not necessary for us to advert to other questions raised at \nthe Bar.  Although we do not agree with the reasons assigned by the High \nCourt, but we uphold the conclusion thereof on different grounds. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\"> \tFor the reasons aforementioned, Civil Appeal arising out of SLP \n(Civil) No.18611 of 2004 filed by M/s Centrotrade Minerals and Metal Inc., \nis dismissed and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (Civil) No.21340 of 2005 \npreferred by Hindustan Copper Ltd. is allowed.
